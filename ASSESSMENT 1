Explanation:

Title: Clearly indicates that the bar graph represents the top 5 states with the highest number of failed banks.
X-axis (State): Displays the state abbreviations.
Y-axis (Number of Failed Banks): Shows the count of failed banks in each state.
Bars: The height of each bar corresponds to the number of failed banks in that state. Taller bars represent states with more failed banks.
Color: The bars are colored 'skyblue' for visual appeal.
Rotation: The state labels on the x-axis are set to horizontal for better readability.
This bar graph provides a visual representation, making it easier to compare the number of failed banks across the top 5 states.
